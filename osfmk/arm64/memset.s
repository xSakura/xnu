/* By default we assume that the DC instruction can be used to zero
   data blocks more efficiently.  In some circumstances this might be
   unsafe, for example in an asymmetric multiprocessor environment with
   different DC clear lengths (neither the upper nor lower lengths are
   safe to use).  The feature can be disabled by defining DONT_USE_DC.

   If code may be run in a virtualized environment, then define
   MAYBE_VIRT.  This will cause the code to cache the system register
   values rather than re-reading them each call.  */
